## Description

Credit card roulette is a game of chance that can be played with two or more people. Everyone in the group provides a method of payment (generally a credit/debit card) and then someone is chosen at random to pay for the entire party.

Hupaze allows you to save details about the occasion and view statistics for each person that you have paid for and who has paid for you.
